We recieved an on-the-job-ticket to modify code for a marketing company. The goal was to create a website that contained accessibility as well as making the code concise.

The company is Horiseon and they offer a service that can help build growth for businesses. 

They needed a programmer to make the source code contain accessibility features. These features will help people with disabilities view the content and also keep the Horiseon URL link at the top of the google searches.
